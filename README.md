# Abstract
We show that any persistence module $M\colon\mathcal{C}\to\\mathsf{Vec}$ over a small category $\mathcal{C}$ which is pointwise finite dimensional admits an essentially unique decomposition into indecomposables with local endomorphism rings.
We start by defining a tensor product of persistence modules and proving a tensor-hom adjunction.
This is then used to prove that pointwise finite dimensional persistence modules are pure-injective, which is key for the proof of the existence of an indecomposable summand from which the existence of the decomposition follows.
Then an adaptation of the Krull-Remak-Schmidt-Azumaya Theorem shows that the decomposition is essentially unique.
